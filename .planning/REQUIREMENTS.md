# Requirements: AI Service Now Vision

**Defined:** 2026-04-14  
**Core Value:** AI agents and humans can submit and complete governed operational requests with reliable approval, fulfillment, and audit trails in one platform.

## v1 Requirements

### Tenant & Identity

- [ ] **TNTY-01**: Every request is resolved to exactly one organization across UI, API, Slack, and webhook channels.
- [ ] **TNTY-02**: Unknown or ambiguous tenant resolution fails closed with explicit error responses.
- [ ] **TNTY-03**: Authorization checks enforce org-scoped least-privilege access for requester, approver, and admin roles.
- [ ] **TNTY-04**: Slack/ChatOps actions map to the correct organization workspace before any request data is read or mutated.

### Governance & Policy

- [ ] **GOV-01**: Policy enforcement defaults to fail-closed in production when policy service is unavailable or invalid.
- [ ] **GOV-02**: High-impact actions require human-in-the-loop approval based on risk tier and policy.
- [ ] **GOV-03**: Emergency override path is time-boxed, auditable, and requires explicit reason metadata.
- [ ] **GOV-04**: Every policy decision records policy version, decision reason, and actor context.

### Request Lifecycle & Reliability

- [ ] **RLY-01**: Request creation, approval decision, and fulfillment transitions are idempotent across retries.
- [ ] **RLY-02**: Fulfillment jobs support deterministic retry/compensation behavior for transient failures.
- [ ] **RLY-03**: Distributed rate limiting uses shared backend primitives and does not silently degrade to per-instance behavior.
- [ ] **RLY-04**: Webhook delivery includes retry with bounded backoff and terminal failure audit events.

### API & Agent Interoperability

- [ ] **API-01**: External API clients can create and query requests with stable, validated contracts.
- [ ] **API-02**: Programmatic request ingestion enforces API key auth, org context checks, and request validation.
- [ ] **API-03**: Agent-executed actions are mediated by scoped permissions and action allowlists.
- [ ] **API-04**: Inbound/outbound integration calls include signature or secret verification where applicable.

### Auditability & Observability

- [ ] **OBS-01**: Every request lifecycle event is written to immutable audit records with actor and timestamp.
- [ ] **OBS-02**: Operators can export request decision and fulfillment history for compliance review.
- [ ] **OBS-03**: Platform emits traceable telemetry for request, policy, and fulfillment flows.
- [ ] **OBS-04**: Operators can diagnose failed automations using correlated request, policy, and connector evidence.

### Automation UX

- [ ] **AUTO-01**: Employees can submit requests with minimal required fields while preserving policy correctness.
- [ ] **AUTO-02**: AI-assisted triage suggests request routing/metadata before approval processing.
- [ ] **AUTO-03**: Requesters and approvers can see clear status and next actions for every request.
- [ ] **AUTO-04**: Automation paths reduce manual handoffs without bypassing governance controls.

## v2 Requirements

### Differentiators

- **DIFF-01**: Risk-adaptive autonomy dynamically switches between auto-approve and HITL based on policy and context.
- **DIFF-02**: Control-tower view monitors and governs multiple AI agents and tool actions.
- **DIFF-03**: Policy simulation mode can replay historical requests before enabling new rules.
- **DIFF-04**: Fulfillment quality feedback loop tunes routing, approvals, and connector strategy.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Full ServiceNow parity across all enterprise modules | Focus remains on AI-company ops and agent-native workflows |
| Native mobile apps | Web and API-first delivery is higher leverage for current users |
| Unbounded autonomous execution without governance controls | Violates trust, safety, and compliance goals |
